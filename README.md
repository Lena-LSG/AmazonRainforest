# AmazonRainforest
Code used in the PA3900 Research Project module during my time at the University of Leicester.

This repository contains the code used to generate plots of NDVI, Precipitation and Land Surface Temperature data in the Amazon rainforest.
This scripts were used with h4 and h5 data packages from the European Space Agency and NASA to conduct analysis on the effects of climate change in the Amazon.
